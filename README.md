# Social-Buzz-Analysis
This project has explored social media engagement by analyzing the best-performing content categories on a given platform called Social Buzz. Through data cleaning and preparation in Excel, data modeling and exploratory data analysis and visualization, I identified the top-performing content categories and their trends over time.
The insights gained from this analysis can be used to inform content creation strategies and improve engagement on social media platforms. Additionally, the discrepancies found between the results from Python and SQL highlight the importance of thorough data exploration and the potential for inconsistencies in different analytical tools. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of data analytics in uncovering insights and driving informed decision-making.
