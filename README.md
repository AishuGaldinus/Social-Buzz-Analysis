# Social-Buzz-Analysis

Social Buzz is a Social Media and Content creation Company. Over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee their scaling process effectively.

Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they  create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain. Out of the 250 people working at Social Buzz, 200 of them are technical staff working on maintaining this highly complex technology.  Up until this point, they have not relied on any third party firms to help them get to where they are. However there are 3 main reasons why they are now looking at bringing in external expertise:  

1) They are looking to complete an IPO by the end of next year and need guidance to ensure that this goes smoothly.
2) They are still a small company and do not have the resources to manage the scale that they are currently at. They could hire more people, but they want an experienced practice to help instead.
3) They want to learn data best practices from a large corporation. Due to the nature of their business, they have a massive amount of data so they are keen on  understanding how the world's biggest companies manage the challenges of big data.

To start the engagement with Social Buzz, the company is running a 3 month initial project in order to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following:  
- An audit of their big data practice
- Recommendations for a successful IPO
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity  

This project has explored social media engagement by analyzing the best-performing content categories at Social Buzz. Through data cleaning and preparation in Excel, data modeling and exploratory data analysis and visualization, I identified the top-performing content categories and their trends over time.

The insights gained from this analysis can be used to inform content creation strategies and improve engagement on social media platforms. Additionally, the discrepancies found between the results from Python and SQL highlight the importance of thorough data exploration and the potential for inconsistencies in different analytical tools. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of data analytics in uncovering insights and driving informed decision-making.
